# Ortelius documentation

This is the documentation repo for Ortelius.

## Based on Docsy Example

[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) is a Hugo theme for technical documentation sites, providing easy site navigation, structure, and more. This **Docsy Example Project** uses the Docsy theme, as well as providing a skeleton documentation structure for you to use. You can either copy this project and edit it with your own content, or use the theme in your projects like any other [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).

This Docsy Example Project is hosted at [https://example.docsy.dev/](https://example.docsy.dev/).  You can find detailed theme instructions in the [Docsy user guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/).

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is currently maintained.
